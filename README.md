SF Aura Basics training

In working through the Trailhead Aura Basics module I was able to build the Camping List App that allows users to create a list a camping items and mark them as packed. 
The application is fully funcional however I am trying to debug why it will not pass the SF training parameters. 
I get the following error : 'The campingList component isn't iterating the array of items and creating campingListItem components.'
I have tried a number of solutions for this error I've found online however none have done the trick. 

I will update my code once I've figured out the problem. Fingers crossed!
